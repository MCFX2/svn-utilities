# svn-utilities
Some convenient Subversion (SVN) commandline utilities I've been working on.

Documentation will be coming soon.

Installation
==
Installation is very easy. Just do:
```sh
source ./install
```
and everything will be set up for you. To update, just run `./install` again.

By default, this installs in your home directory using `~/.mcfx2svn` as a home base. This can safely be changed the install script if desired.

Usage
